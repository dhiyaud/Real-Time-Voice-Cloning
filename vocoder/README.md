# Synthesizer

This is directory for Vocoder model.

## Please note:

### 1. Change Vocoder

The default vocoder in this repository is WaveRNN.

To use another vocoder (WaveNet, HiFi-GAN), please refer to the `repositories` folder in my root directory.

### 2. Use Speaker Conditional

To use Speaker Conditional for the vocoder, please retrain and use file with suffix `xx_sc.py` inside the vocoder directory.
